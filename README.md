I have successfully managed multi-channel ticketing systems, integrating email, web forms, and phone channels for a centralized support system. Additionally, I configured and monitored Service Level Agreements (SLAs), ensuring timely responses and adherence to company policies, which significantly improved service delivery and customer satisfaction.

I have configured custom forms and workflows to meet specific business requirements, enabling departments to capture relevant data for ticket resolution. By defining custom ticket statuses and tailoring the system to fit the needs of each department, I ensured that osTicket was fully aligned with the company's operational needs and support processes.

I have implemented best practices for securing sensitive customer data within osTicket, including configuring role-based access control and encryption. Additionally, I managed backup and recovery processes to ensure the integrity of the support system, minimizing downtime and data loss in case of system failures.
